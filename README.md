# 🐉 Dragon Cursor — Ultimate PRO

A pure **HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript** project where your cursor is stalked by a **line-art dragon**.  
It stalks, lunges, breathes flames on click, and shows 3D motion using only **lines & geometry**.

## 🎮 Features
- Line-only dragon with 3D illusion (spine, ribs, spikes, 4 wings).  
- Cursor stalking & lunge behavior ("give it a chance" and it attacks).  
- Hold **Left-Click** → Dragon breathes heavy flames.  
- Motion trails for cinematic effect.  
- Works fullscreen, lightweight, no external libraries.
